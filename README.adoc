Terminal Emulator for Android
=============================

https://termoneplus.com/


"TermOne Plus" is an Android application that turns your Android device into an computer terminal. It is successor of abandoned Jack Palevich's terminal emulator.

Terminal is useful for accessing the command line shell (built into every Android phone) or use custom one (installed separately). This allows you to run various command line utilities.
It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes. Supported terminal types include vt100, screen (default), linux and xterm. As result console programs like "vi" (unix visual editor), "emacs", "mc" (Midnight Commander file manager), nano (Nano's ANOther editor) and other work smoothly.

Code of "TermOne Plus" is hosted in https://gitlab.com/termapps/termoneplus[public repository].
